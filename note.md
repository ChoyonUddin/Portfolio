Crazy how I've been using divs and previous commits as notes rather than actually making notes. Anyways got favicon working, and added a note.md file to the portfolio folder. I'm going to start making notes in here from now on.
Next steps are going to be to add a blog page, and then start working on the actual portfolio page.
I'm thinking just a little about me section and someother stuff
-Projects
-Languages
-Hobbies
-Other Stuff I've done
