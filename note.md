Crazy how I've been using divs and previous commits as notes rather than actually making notes. Anyways got favicon working, and added a note.md file to the portfolio folder. I'm going to start making notes in here from now on.
Next steps are going to be to add a blog page, and then start working on the actual portfolio page.
I'm thinking just a little about me section and someother stuff
-Projects
-Languages
-Hobbies
-Other Stuff I've done

Ok so today I was trying to make my website such that a small portion of the top half was black where my header is and then it goes into the rest of the screen with the default mombo jumbo but i couldn't figure out a couple of things which took me awhile to figure. Right now got no where with it but now instead I have a linear gradient that flows from black to my background colour. First off biggest run on sentence ever, second off now the edges of the screen just wont cooperate with me and I don't know why :sob:. All good ill figure it out tmr. For now, Good night.

Ok so its not that I have lost interest in my project, I have just been busy this week having a midterm on saturday and plans for the weekend (Halloween weekend) so I will get back to the grind soon and finish this project. Oh I also cant commit some changes I've done due to some error with I'm having with the background not hitting the edges of my screeen. I'll figure it out soon. Inshallah.

Wow, hiatus went crazy literally Hunter X Hunter game back before I did, yeah not gonna lie I'm just gonna leave this as it is cause is a good reminder of how I was when I was starting out. I'll make an actual portfolio website later in the future after I start finishing up my projects. Speaking of which I should probably start fixing the files in this repo too cause they are a mess.
